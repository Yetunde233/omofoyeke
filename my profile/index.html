    <h1 id="bio"> BIOGRAPHY</h1>
    <p> I am <strong>Ibraheem Rodiyat Yetunde</strong>, a proud indigene of <strong>Osun State</strong>, though much of my early life and upbringing took place in <strong>Ekiti State Nigeria</strong>. My life journey so far has been one of self-discovery, determination, and continuous learning, as I transition from a science background to the world of technology and creative writing..</p>
    <p>I hold a degree in <strong>Biochemistry</strong> from <strong>Federal University Oye Ekiti (FUOYE)</strong>. Studying biochemistry taught me how to think analytically, solve problems, and understand the world from a scientific perspective. However, as I grew and explored different fields, I found myself increasingly drawn to technology—specifically the dynamic world of web development.  </p>
    <p>At present, I am actively pursuing skills in web development, learning to build websites and digital solutions that solve real-world problems. For me, transitioning into tech is not just a career shift; it represents a personal transformation. I believe technology is shaping the future and I want to be part of that change—not as a passive observer, but as an active contributor. My goal is to become a professional web developer, capable of creating digital experiences that are not only functional but also innovative and user-friendly. </p> 
    <p>Beyond coding, I am also passionate about writing—a skill I nurture alongside my technical training. In my free time, I turn to writing as a way to express myself, explore ideas, and connect with others. Whether it's crafting stories, reflecting on life lessons, or sharing personal experiences, writing allows me to think creatively and stay connected to my inner voice. It's more than just a hobby; it's a personal outlet that keeps my imagination alive and sharpens my communication skills. </p>
    <p> Balancing my journey between science, technology, and creativity has shaped me into a multi-dimensional learner. I've learned that growth often comes from stepping outside your comfort zone. Choosing to move from biochemistry to tech required courage, but it also opened doors to new opportunities and passions I might never have discovered otherwise </p>
    <p>Looking ahead, my vision is clear: I aspire to build a career as a web developer while continuing to grow as a writer. I want to use both skills to create, inspire, and contribute</p>
